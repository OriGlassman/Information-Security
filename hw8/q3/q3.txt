By looking at run.py, I saw there is no vulnerability that will print hacked in the validation function, so I knew that the file data needs to get validated. By looking at the validation checking, I saw that the it computes the indexes it checks from the file, and if the indexes are 0 and 1 respectively by their tests in the function, it gets empty strings, so empty string == empty string and it gets passed the validation. Once it gets passed the validation, the command get executed, so simply the command in the file in echo hacked.
