"It does make the validation pretty slow, so what" - so what :), well, we might as well do anything we want. Since it opens the file, gets the value of the command, and then starts a sequence of validation which takes alot of time. In that time, I can replace the contents in the file (change it from echo cool, which has a valid signature, with the command I want, which is echo hacked). Since after validation and before executing the command, it doesn't recheck for revalidation (which is a cat and mouse play, but will be harder for an attacker to time between the last validation and just before the execution) - it just executes the command I want. So in q5.py I create a json file named whatever which has the content of example.json; then I run the run.py with a child process, sleep 2 seconds (so that it will retrieve the echo cool command for sure), then change the echo cool to echo hacked. Now I wait for the process to finish execution with wait(). Once the process has finished, I return the content of whatever.json to the original state, no harm done :) (at least visually).
