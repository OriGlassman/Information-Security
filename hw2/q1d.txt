As described in the exercise instructions, I iterate (using an iterator, saving space) over all possibilities while keeping a max variable that upon decryption and calculating the plaintext_score, checks if the plaintext_score is higher than the max variable, if so, change the max variable to the current score and keep the plaintext. When finished iterating all options, the plaintext that scored the must remains, and I return it.
