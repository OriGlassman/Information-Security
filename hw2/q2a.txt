Since we know the PIN code is small, 4 digits, we can simply iterate over all the PINS and calculate their encryption (since the parameters are public) and check if we have a match between the calculated encryption and the encrypted plaintext we got. With high probability, the PIN that lead to a match of the encrypted plaintext are the same. The probability that we would get a collision (different pins, same encryption) and small since we use fairly small domain and the public parameter n is very big.
