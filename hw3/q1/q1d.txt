We can see in IDA that before the comparision of al and the second byte, there is a "movzx eax, [ebp + var_A]", since var_A is only 1 bytes, which puts 7 bytes of zero in eax and only 1 byte of content (al). So, instead of looking to the first byte (al) in "setz" command, I made it look to AH (c4 instead of c0 at the hex dump) register, which is practially zero, so "setz" always return 1
