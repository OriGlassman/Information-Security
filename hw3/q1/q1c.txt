Instead of calculating what should be the second byte, I can make sure that there are no iterations in the loop (by changing the first byte to 0x00), in which case it is just checked if the second byte is equal to the original key, which is OxA2. So I just changed the first byte to 0x00, the second byte to 0xA2. In this case, regardless of the text, it will always return valid message.
