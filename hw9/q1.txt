To get the required .pcap file I simply opened wireshark, filtered with http, took only the first packet and exported it as pcap file.
Packet_filter checks if its not an empty packet, if so check if the destination port is 80 (aka http). I took the liberty and did some thing a bit different as I wasn't sure http is restricted to tcp so I checked the destination port of the packet, not the port specific in the layer of the tcp (from google http not most be over tcp). 
in parse_packet I check if the packet has a raw layer and is a login request from our website. If so, get the load and send to the parse_qs of the urlpase module. It returns a dictionary with two of its keys are password and username, and I return them as a 2-tuple.
