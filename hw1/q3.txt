If ESI holds an address representing a string, in the end ECX will hold the length of that string (assuming it is null terminated \0).
If ESI holds a random address, it just counts how many consecutive bytes there is until it encounters a byte of 0 in the place the address points to.

Explanation of the code:

Line 1 get the counter (ECX) to 0
Line 2 get EDX to zero, which causes DL (the lsb byte) to be zero
Line 3 is the condition we check everytime
Line 4 compares the byte ESI is pointing to, compared to zeros
Line 5 checks if the flag indicating the result is zero (meaning they were equal, hence ESI was pointing to a 0 byte)
Line 6 increases the counter by one
Line 7 causes the address in esi to point to the consecutive byte which was last pointed at
Line 8 is the return to the start of the loop
Line 9 marks the end of the program
