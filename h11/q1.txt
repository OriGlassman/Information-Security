Looking at the server code, it first tries to read a cookie named login, if it fails to do so it redirects the user to the log in page. Cookies are normally only created after the user authenticated correctly in the log in page (saw that from the login function). So, what if I create my own cookie, without entering a password and a user name in the log in page. I can create a cookie named 'login' with its value being the username I want to log in as (it needs to be encoded in BASE64, as in the server it decodes the string in BASE64,so I used btoa in js) edward, and then after refreshing, it see's the cookie and bam we're in.
