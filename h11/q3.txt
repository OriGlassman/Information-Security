Vulnerability: XSS injection. the parsing and escaping check is not good enough.
Exploit: send a message in a forum that will try to load an image with src=http:// (it passes validation since it's a valid prefix and there's no <script> tag), for obious reasons it will fail, but, we add onerror tag, which will always start execute (again, because it won't succeed in displaying an img from the address http://, because thats a broken address). In the onerror, we inject our js code. Whoever sees the message we sent in our channel will immediately start executing our js code (hence xss injection). Ok, to the hiding part:
So at the first time when our onerror code starts to execute, it checks if a flag is on, otherwise it puts the right image of the cat and then turning on a "flag", I used the localStorage from your advise to save the state.
Once the cat image is displayed, a refresh or switching to some other channel, replaces the html contents and put it back to normal. when the user has loaded the channel again, our code will run again, but this time our flag will be on, leaving the src empty thus not showing the cat image anymore.
