The encryption and decryption are standard, nothing special to discuss. But, the padding is to be discussed. I tried importing PKCS7, no luck whatsoever. Every module I tried to include that included pkcs7 was not installed. So I took a "padding scheme" from stackoverflow, which always pad 1 to 16 bytes, as much as needed. The bytes that are padded are the amount of padding that was done. Since we always pad with something (we actually pad with 16 bytes when no actually padding is needed, thats the disadvantage), julia only needs to read the last byte of the deciphered text, and from that she knows the length of the padding.
