Vulnerability: iptables that can be controled to some extent from the outside.
Exploit: Say me, an attacker that wants to crash or make  someone who is running the firewall from the last section, run very slow. What I'll do is as following: create a python script with scapy, and spoof the source ip. Send 16 packets to the user who's running the anti virus, spoof another ip, send 16 packets, so on and so forth.
What this does is create  firewall rules roughly as much as there are ip addresses. This would obiously make the user iterate over the firewall rules every time he gets a new packet to check if there is a certain rule currently in the firewall, rendering him unconnected to the internet and possibly cause him to crash.
Other vulnerability includes spoofing some useful ip (say ip of google.com), send him 16 packets from that ip. Now he will be unable to make a connection to google. Other rather standard vulnerability is spoof ip's and send a syn packet to block or crash his queue.
